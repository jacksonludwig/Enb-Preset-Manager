ENBSeries v0.309 BETA for TES Skyrim SE.

Made all post processing shaders similar or equal to mod for Fallout 4. Time of the day,
interior and exterior separation, weather system are not available yet. This version
is mostly to remove original game post processing by replacing it with custom from
enbeffect.fx shader (untweaked, most code from old Skyrim mod) or ReShade/SweetFX.


WARNING! For compatibility with some other software (i call it crapware) read "problems"
category of this document, it's very important to not have any other tools hooking in to
game process or graphics. Crashes, graphic artifacts after installing ENB mods/patches
almost always means crapware is running.
